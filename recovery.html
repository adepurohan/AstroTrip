  <h2>Recovery</h2>
  <p>The recovery process is a critical aspect of space tourism and our company takes it very seriously. We have a well-established and tested plan in place to ensure the safe recovery of our spacecraft and passengers after a successful mission. This plan includes the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The spacecraft's descent into the Earth's atmosphere</li>
    <li>Deployment of parachutes to slow the spacecraft's descent</li>
    <li>Tracking and communication with the spacecraft during the descent</li>
    <li>Recovery of the spacecraft and passengers by our trained personnel</li>
    <li>Post-mission medical evaluation of passengers and crew</li>
    <li>Return of passengers and crew to their departure location</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our spacecraft are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere and our recovery procedures have been tested and refined over many missions. We are confident in our ability to recover our spacecraft and passengers safely after every mission.</p>
