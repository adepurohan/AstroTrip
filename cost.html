      <h2>Cost Information</h2>
      <p>The cost of space exploration varies greatly depending on the mission and type of vehicle being used. Some factors that contribute to the cost include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Development and construction of the spacecraft or launch vehicle</li>
        <li>Launch services and facilities</li>
        <li>Payloads and scientific instruments</li>
        <li>Mission operations and support</li>
        <li>Data analysis and dissemination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In general, missions to low Earth orbit (LEO) are less expensive than missions to the moon or other destinations in our solar system. The cost of a LEO mission can range from tens of millions to several billion dollars, while missions to the moon or Mars can cost tens of billions of dollars.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that the cost of space exploration is not only monetary, but also includes the risk to human life and the investment of time and resources. Nevertheless, the benefits of exploring space, such as advancing our understanding of the universe and developing new technologies, make it a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
